                        Business Analysis and Systems Design is the study of concepts, processes and tools that professionals use to plan and develop information systems to industry standards. Students learn how to ask implicit questions, to create and document communication plans and to make better decisions prior to creating a software system. Beginning with an introduction to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), students work in teams to initiate the system process, analyze problems, discover requirements and create a logical design.

                        Students learn to work in a collaborative environment and complete a small-scale software project: a mobile-friendly web application. The course is focused on developing the essential technical skills that will allow a student to develop a functional web application project. The course takes students through the UX design process which includes creating and administering surveys & interviews, creating personas and user stories, designing wireframes, and performing user tests with a developed implementation that is based on the UX design process.

                        Information technology professionals spend time each day communicating orally and in writing with their supervisors, colleagues and clients. As problem-solvers and entrepreneurs in industry, you need to communicate quickly, clearly, and effectively. This course will teach you how to be a professional and efficient communicator at work. You will write effective business correspondence and instructions and deliver a formal oral presentation to your set. The first term establishes the principles and basic patterns on which you will build more advanced applications in the second term.

                        COMP 1113 is partially discrete mathematics, partially an introduction to linear equations. The purpose of this course is to give a strong foundation for future technical and programming courses. The course is divided into three parts: (1) Boolean algebra and design of logic circuits; (2) number systems and data representation; and (3) functions, linear equations, vectors and matrices.
